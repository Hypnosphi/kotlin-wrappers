This module contains a live example.
You could and should use this module to check if your changes are still working.
Like manual unit testing.
Also, you could put more examples and use as a sandbox for experiments.

### Run

```
./gradlew webpack-run

./gradlew webpack-stop
```

After webpack is running, you could rebuild the project (ctrl + F9), and webpack will catch all changes.
